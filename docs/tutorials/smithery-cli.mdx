# Overview

The [Smithery CLI](https://github.com/smithery-ai/cli) provides a quick way to install and manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It works with any AG-UI compatible client and is a fast way to explore different server implementations.

This guide walks through installing the CLI, grabbing a sample server, and running it end to end.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **v18 or later**
- A Smithery account and API key

## 1. Install the CLI

You can run the tool directly via `npx`:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli --help
```

The first run downloads the CLI and shows the available commands.

## 2. Login

Authenticate the CLI so it can fetch servers from the registry:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli login
```

Follow the prompt and paste your API key.

## 3. Install a server

Smithery hosts many prebuilt MCP servers. For example, install the `mcp-obsidian` server for the `claude` client:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install mcp-obsidian --client claude
```

You can list available clients and installed servers with:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli list clients
npx @smithery/cli list servers --client claude
```

## 4. Run the server

Start the server with any required configuration:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli run mcp-obsidian --config '{"vaultPath":"/path/to/vault"}'
```

The CLI launches the server locally. You will see the MCP endpoint URL in the output.

## 5. Connect via AG-UI

Once the server is running you can point any AG-UI compatible client or application at the MCP endpoint. The server streams events that AG-UI can render or forward into your own interface.

This completes the full loop: user input flows through AG-UI to the MCP server and the responses stream back for display.

## Next steps

Explore other Smithery servers or build your own. The CLI's `dev` command lets you hotâ€‘reload custom servers and even open a playground to test them interactively.
