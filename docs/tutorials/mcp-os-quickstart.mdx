---

This tutorial walks through building a minimal MCP‑OS proof of concept. We will
run an MCP server with the
**[Smithery CLI](https://github.com/smithery-ai/cli)** and connect to it with a
small AG‑UI client.

## 1. Install prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **v18+**
- A Smithery account and API key

## 2. Start a sample MCP server

Install the Smithery CLI and launch a server:

```bash
npx @smithery/cli login
npx @smithery/cli install mcp-obsidian --client claude
npx @smithery/cli run mcp-obsidian
```

The output prints the local MCP endpoint URL. Export it for the client to use:

```bash
export MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

## 3. Run the MCP shell examples

Two minimal clients are provided to connect to your server.

### TypeScript

Run the `mcp-shell.ts` script with **ts-node**:

```bash
npx ts-node typescript-sdk/examples/mcp-shell.ts
```

### Python

Alternatively you can use the Python example:

```bash
python python-sdk/examples/mcp_shell.py
```

Both scripts send a greeting message to the server and stream back MCP events.
These events describe the UI state that an MCP‑OS shell would render.

## 4. Next steps

Modify the example to forward user input from your own interface and render the
returned component tree. This forms the basis of an MCP‑OS style workflow where
the UI is generated on demand by the server.
