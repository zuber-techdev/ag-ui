This tutorial walks through building a minimal MCP‑OS proof of concept. We'll
run the included AG‑UI server starter and connect to it with a small client.

## 1. Install prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) **3.12+**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## 2. Start a sample MCP server

Clone the repository and launch the server-starter example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/typescript-sdk/integrations/server-starter/server/python
poetry install && poetry run dev
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8000`. Export it for the client:

```bash
export MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## 3. Run the MCP shell examples

Two minimal clients are provided to connect to your server.

### TypeScript

Run the `mcp-shell.ts` script with **ts-node**:

```bash
npx ts-node typescript-sdk/examples/mcp-shell.ts
```

### Python

Alternatively you can use the Python example:

```bash
python python-sdk/examples/mcp_shell.py
```

Both scripts send a greeting message to the server and stream back MCP events.
These events describe the UI state that an MCP‑OS shell would render.

## 4. Next steps

Modify the example to forward user input from your own interface and render the
returned component tree. This forms the basis of an MCP‑OS style workflow where
the UI is generated on demand by the server.
