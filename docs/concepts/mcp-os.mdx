# MCP-OS

The **Model Context Protocol Operating System (MCP-OS)** is a post-app operating system concept where the user interface and application logic are generated in real time by a large language model. Rather than shipping fully implemented applications, MCP-OS relies on a thin rendering shell that communicates with an AI kernel through a well defined protocol.

## System architecture

MCP-OS is composed of three core components:

1. **MCP-Kernel** – a stateless large language model that receives requests and generates protocol compliant responses.
2. **MCP-Shell** – a lightweight renderer that captures user input, formats protocol requests and displays the declarative UI tree returned by the kernel.
3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – the structured message format used for all communication between shell and kernel.

These pieces form a continuous loop: the shell packages user actions as an MCP request, the kernel reasons about the current context, and the resulting MCP response describes the next UI state to display.

## Model Context Protocol

An MCP **request** contains the user's context, the current UI state and an event describing their action:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1.0",
  "session_id": "sid_example_1234",
  "user_context": { "name": "Alex" },
  "current_ui_state": {
    "view_id": "view_home",
    "component_tree_hash": "abcd1234"
  },
  "event": {
    "type": "click",
    "target": { "component_id": "desktop_icon_documents" }
  }
}
```

The **response** from the kernel is a declarative UI tree describing what should be displayed next:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1.0",
  "session_id": "sid_example_1234",
  "directive": "REPLACE_VIEW",
  "new_ui_state": {
    "view_id": "view_documents",
    "component_tree": {
      "component": "Window",
      "children": [ { "component": "ListView" } ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example workflow

1. The user clicks an icon. The shell emits an MCP request with the click event.
2. The kernel processes the request, reasons about the context and generates a response describing a new view.
3. The shell renders the new view exactly as described.
4. Any further interaction restarts the loop with a new request.

This architecture eliminates hardcoded application logic and allows the operating system to adapt the UI to the user's current needs.

## Challenges

While promising, MCP-OS must address latency, state consistency, operating costs and security. The protocol forms the foundation for tackling these issues by enforcing a clear separation between the rendering shell and the reasoning kernel.
